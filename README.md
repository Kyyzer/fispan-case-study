## Overview and Origin

Fispan (FISPAN Services Inc.) was incorporated on July 15th 2016 in Vancouver, Canada<sup>([1])</sup>. Founded by CEO, Lisa Shields, and co-founded with Andrea Zand (Operations), Clayton Weir (Product & Strategy) and Val Novikov (Chief Technical Officer)<sup>([2])</sup>.

Fispan is privately held and funded by investors including: FinTop Capital, Rhino Ventures, Panache Ventures and Business Development Bank of Canada. As of January 2021, the company has raised a total of $19 million USD<sup>([3])</sup>.

### The Genesis story of Fispan

After selling her first business, Hyperwallet, to Paypal for $400 million USD in 2018<sup>([4])</sup>, Shields proceeded to, as described by her, "literally sat in (her) basement for a year" and founded her second company, Fispan. Shields describes Fispan as a "very intentional business", and took into consideration two main observations:
- Financial institutions primarily focus on retail consumer banking and she believed "there were huge opportunites to make the world better for businesses", and
- Banks had "superior payments products, superior cash management services, superior loans... (due to) lower cost of capital"<sup>([5])</sup>

so instead of creating a service that sought to replace banks, she wanted a service that worked with banks.
