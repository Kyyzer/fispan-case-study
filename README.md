## Overview and Origin

Fispan (FISPAN Services Inc.) was incorporated on July 15th 2016 in Vancouver, Canada<sup>([1])</sup>. Founded by CEO, Lisa Shields, and co-founded with Andrea Zand (Operations), Clayton Weir (Product & Strategy) and Val Novikov (Chief Technical Officer)<sup>([2])</sup>.

Fispan is privately held and funded by investors including: FinTop Capital, Rhino Ventures, Panache Ventures and Business Development Bank of Canada. As of January 2021, the company has raised a total of $19 million USD<sup>([3])</sup>.

### The Genesis story of Fispan

After selling her first business, Hyperwallet, to Paypal for $400 million USD in 2018<sup>([4])</sup>, as described by her, Shields "literally sat in (her) basement for a year" and founded her second company, Fispan. Shields describes Fispan as a "very intentional business", and took into consideration two main observations:
- Financial institutions primarily focus on retail consumer banking and she believed "there were huge opportunities to make the world better for businesses", and
- Banks had "superior payments products, superior cash management services, superior loans... (due to) lower cost of capital"<sup>([5])</sup>

So instead of creating a service that sought to replace banks, Shields wanted a service that worked with banks.

## Business Activities

Fispan attempts to address the lengthy process that banks undergo to integrate their digital banking with the ERPs and accounting software of their commercial and corporate customers. Co-founder Clayton Weir describes how their platform "make(s) it easy for banks to extend their services offering ... by embedding commercial banking applications within the organisation's software"<sup>([6])</sup>.

Fispan uniquely offers its platform directly to banks instead of attempting to become a neo-bank such as [Northone](https://www.northone.com/) or [Starling Bank](https://www.starlingbank.com/). This allows fispan's platform to reach the already established commercial and corporate customer bases of large financial institutions, and integrate with the existing services the banks can provide.

Fispan's API also integrates with some legacy ERPs which enable financial institutions to bring their online banking services to more of their customers. Their banking customers can then continue to use their systems and slowly migrate towards more modern digital solutions.

### Features and Technologies

- API (Application Programming Interface) brings the client's banking services natively into their business ERP and accounting software
- Cloud computing stores client information by remote network machines

### Partners

Fispan's banking partners collectively hold $8 trillion in assets and include eight of the largest banks in North America<sup>([3])</sup>. More notably in late 2018, Fispan announced its partnership with JP Morgan Chase, in a project to help develop pilot programs for the corporate treasurers of Chase's business banking customers<sup>([8])</sup>.

2020 also saw Fispan join Mastercard's Start Path accelerator program. The program gives access to the knowledge of Mastercard experts and technologies to support innovation in the payments and financial services industries"<sup>([9])</sup>.

## Domain Landscape

Digital banking at its inception, two decades ago, was seen only as an e-commerce interest. Today's digital wave has seen digital banking become mainstream, and the same focus is now also applied to payments, retail banking, insurance, wealth management and also capital markets and commercial banking.<sup>([10])</sup>

Neo-banks have also entered the market, completely online banks with no physical infrastructure, designed to offer the same products and services one would expect from a standard 'brick and mortar' bank.<sup>([11])</sup> This has prompted incumbent banks to undertake digitisation where they are presented with two choices:
- First option is the digitise the core front-to-back, a complete transformation of their existing processes and developing their own digital infrastructure
- Second option is to invest in a neobank or a digital attacker and migrate product offerings to the neobank first while simplifying their own processes<sup>([7])</sup>

### Competitors

## Results

**Digital Engagement** is a key measure of success for providers of digital solutions, especially as more consumers are adopting digital channels, because it not only shows user satisfaction but is the main way for providers to improve their product. A study by the Deloitte Center for Financial Services found that user satisfaction of their banks is very closely correlated to how likely they would advocate for their banks.<sup>([12])</sup>

JP Morgan is one of the partnerships announced by Fispan. Jason Tiede, Managing Director at JP Morgan has stated the project has already seen "over 40 of their large technology clients on the platform with about fifty to sixty more in the implementation side"<sup>([13])</sup>.

**Market Share** can also determine the profitability of a business. The greater the size of a business and their coverage can allow them to bargain more effectively and realise significantly higher prices for a particular product<sup>([14])</sup>.

Fispan having raised a total of $19 million USD is now planning on building teams in Asia-Pacific region and Europe, to extend their bank customer base and services.

## Recommendations

### Digital assistant

Chatbots and digital assistants are now common in online services, with banks included. Fispan offers a digital product so they could benefit from developing an online assistant built into the customer's ERP that can help solve any technical or business banking queries. The service would develop through machine learning and natural language processing, and could even integrate with the banks systems to suggest products.

### Open banking

Open banking is the future and provides a significant opportunity for FinTechs. Banks will turn to FinTechs and give platform access to those determined as trustworthy and valuable partners. Fispan should consider integrating the open banking and data sharing into its platform, which could help banking customers aggregate their business activities across multiple banks. This will require further development in APIs and Cloud Infrastructure. By developing this technology now, it prepares Fispan for when North America mandates open banking (although countries such as Australia have already initiated the regulation) and ensures that it is functional and secure for the consumer<sup>([15])</sup>.
